### Open-Source technology, training, strategy for Tibet & the world.




> The Tibet Action Institute brings together thought leaders, campaigners, and technology experts at the forefront of the Tibet movement in order to develop and implement visionary end-game strategies designed to help Tibetans win their nonviolent struggle for rights and freedom. We develop and deploy technology systems, map and execute big-picture campaigning, and offer training in safe and secure use of information and communication technologies and the art and methods of strategic nonviolent resistance.
