summary: "Nyima Lhamo's journey, and her quest for justice for her uncle who was wrongly imprisoned by China, sheds light on the many ways China tries to control and intimidate Tibetans, including through the use of transnational repression. April 2024 marks 22 years since Tenzin Delek Rinpoche's was arrested. One of the most prominent Tibetan political prisoners in recent Tibetan history, his untimely death in a Chinese prison in 2015 remains both a mystery and a tragedy. In this interview, Nyima Lhamo shares her touching memories of Rinpoche in Tibet and reveals the extreme measures she and her family were driven in their fight for truth and justice."
