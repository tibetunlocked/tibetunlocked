summary: "In December 2021, Tibet Action Institute released a groundbreaking report uncovering China's massive Colonial Boarding School system in Tibet. In order to eliminate Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule, Beijing has now separated nearly 80% of all Tibetan children (ages of six - 18) from their families and communities. In this episode we discuss the key findings and story behind the writing of the report."
