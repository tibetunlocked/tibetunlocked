Timeshifting, VCRs, DVRs and streaming make watching on demand possible and, by handing us the remote, perhaps a more desirable experience. Netflixâ€™s arrival to Australian shores has had a massive effect on our viewing habits - and the experience of Netflix is fundamentally different to TV. Itâ€™s on demand, all available, ad free and cheap - so will it kill TV?</p>
